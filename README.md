**Microsoft Movie Studio Recommendation**

**Overview**

This project aims to provide sound and profitable recommendations to Microsoft Movie Studio for entering the movie industry. The movie industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry that generates significant profits for movie studios. To make informed decisions, a careful and meticulous analysis has been conducted on movie data to answer critical questions:

* What genre of movies should Microsoft produce?
* What runtime is preferred by viewers?
* What is the average budget for well-performing movies in the chosen genre?
*  What revenue can be expected from the investment?
* Is there a correlation between various factors, such as revenue and audience appeal?


**Purpose and Objectives**

The purpose of this project is to guide Microsoft Movie Studio in making informed decisions for successful movie production. The objectives are as follows:

* Identify the most popular movie genres based on viewership.
* Analyze the preferred movie runtime for better budget planning and viewer engagement.
* Determine the average budget of well-performing movies in the chosen genre.
* Estimate the expected revenue from the investment.
*Identify potential correlations between factors that may affect the movie's success.

**Methodology and Techniques**

The analysis is performed using Python programming language, and the following methodologies and techniques are applied:

* Data Collection: Movie data from IMDb and The Numbers is collected using pandas library.
* Data Cleaning: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, convert data types, and remove special characters.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, are created to explore movie genres, runtime distribution, and other key insights.
* Data Merging: Data from multiple sources is merged to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
* Budget and Revenue Analysis: The average budget and revenue analysis is performed to determine the profitability of well-performing movies.
* Rating Analysis: Movie ratings and the number of votes are analyzed to identify viewer preferences and correlations.
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used to create informative plots and charts for better understanding of the data.

**Instructions to Reproduce Results**

To reproduce the results and run the code:

* Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
* Install Required Libraries: Install the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) by running pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn.
* Download the Dataset: Download the IMDb datasets (imdb.title.basics.csv, imdb.title.ratings.csv) and The Numbers dataset (tn.movie_budgets.csv).
* Place the Datasets: Place the downloaded datasets in the same directory as the Python code.
* Run the Code: Execute the Python code to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
* Interpret the Results: Review the generated visualizations and analysis in the Jupyter Notebook or the interactive environment.

**Conclusion**

The comprehensive analysis performed in this project recommends Microsoft Movie Studio to focus on producing documentary films with a runtime of 60 to 90 minutes. Documentary films have been shown to be highly rated and profitable. Additionally, they offer an excellent return on investment compared to other genres. The analysis provides valuable insights for Microsoft to enter the movie industry successfully and make data-driven decisions for movie production.
